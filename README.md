# W6-Weather-Dashboard

## Project Functionality
The Weather Dashboard, powered by OpenWeather API, allows the user to search up cities and locations across the globe, and retrieve information about the weather within such locations. This information includes the current temperature, UV Index, wind speed, humidity as well as the temperature, wind speed, and humidity of the location for the next five days.

In addition, once you use the search, the entry is logged on the sidebar, which allows you to revisit that city at any moment. There is also a button to clear past entries once you are finished with your business with those locations.
